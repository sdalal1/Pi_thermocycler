## README
This repository is a code for the IOT based thermo cycler. The purpose of this was to test glass made of different polymers at different temperature to determine their strength. 

The flowchart was as follows:

### Key Points

<ol>
<li>Used Python on Raspberry pi </li>
<li>Constant reiteration of variables and code to reach the optimum efficiency and testing</li>
<li>Used software integrated control system PID loop to create an efficient cycler </li>
<li>Calibrated heating and cooling sensors</li>
<li>Used HTML and CSS for basic IoT integration</li>
</ol>
The video of the test run is as follows. The use of a plastic container was used for testing a closed enviorment and safety.
